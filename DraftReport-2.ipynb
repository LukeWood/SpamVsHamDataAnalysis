    "SMS messages play a huge role in a peron's life, and the confidentiality and integrity of said messages are of the highest priority to mobile carriers around the world. Due to this fact, many unlawful individuals and groups try and take advatange of the average consumer by flooding their inbox with spam, and while the majority of people successfully avoid it, there are people out there affected negatively by falling for false messages.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The data we selected is a compilation of 5574 SMS messages acquired from a variety of different sources, broke down in the following way: 452 of the messages came from the Grumbletext Web Site, 3375 of the messages were taken from the NUS SMS Corpus (database with legitimate message from the University of Singapore), 450 messages collected from Caroline Tag's PhD Thesis, and the last 1324 messages were from the SMS Spam Corpus v.0.1 Big. \n",

    "This data was collected initially for studies on deciphering the differences between a spam or ham (legitimate) messages. Uses for this research can involve advanced spam filtering technology or improved datasets for machine learning programs. However, a slight problem with this data set, as with most localized language-based datasets, is that due to the relatively small area of sampling, there are a lot of regional data points (such as slang, acronyms, etc) that can be considering \"useless\" data if a much more generalized data set is wanted. For our specific project however, we are keeping all this data in order for us to analyze it and get a better understanding of our data.\n",
